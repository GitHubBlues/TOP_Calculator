# **Calculator** 

The calculator has functionality for carrying out the four main mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). It is able to work with float numbers and integers and can be used by clicking on the computer screen as well as by using the keyboard. Note that the division operator does not work in Firefox, as the browser uses the division slash for opening the quick find bar.

The obkective of this project was to gain further practice in javascript (create funtions, events (click and keyup) and DOM manipulation).

The calculator is available at: https://githubblues.github.io/TOP_Calculator/

This project was executed in the context of "The Odin Project" web-development course. A detailed description of the requirements to be met by the calculator is found at: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator.
